## 📌 Project Description

The project provides a basic yet functional demo of wallet integration and ETH transfer using MetaMask. It includes a "Connect Wallet" button to initiate wallet connection, displays the connected wallet address, and a "Pay" button that sends 0.00001 ETH (in testnet) to a fixed recipient address. It also handles wallet disconnection and account changes.

Use case: This can be a starting point for building more complex Web3 apps such as NFT marketplaces, tipping platforms, crowdfunding DApps, or token swap interfaces.
